## Evaluation Corpus for Named Entity Recognition using Europarl

This repository contains a gold-standard test set created from the [Europarl corpus](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/). The test set consists of 799 sentences manually annotated using four entity types and following the [CoNLL 2002 and 2003 guidelines](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) for 4 languages: English, German, Italian and Spanish.

In order to obtain the final 799 annotated sentences for each language, the first 2000 sentence from the Europarl corpus were used for each of the languages. The word alignments were obtained via Giza++, which was trained on the rest of the Europarl corpus (e.g., Europarl minus the first 2000 sentences).
